        Our mission is to raise awareness about the detrimental effects of
        improper disposal of electronics and textiles on the environment, and to
        promote sustainable solutions that mitigate pollution. Improper disposal
        of electronics is a significant source of pollution, as e-waste contains
        toxic substances such as lead, cadmium, and mercury that can leach into
        the soil and waterways. According to the United Nations, the world
        generates approximately 50 million tonnes of e-waste each year, and only
        a fraction of this is properly recycled or disposed of. This leads to
        environmental pollution, as well as health hazards for humans and
        animals. In addition to electronics, textiles are also a major
        contributor to waste and pollution. The fashion industry is known for
        its fast-paced production cycles, which lead to a high volume of
        discarded clothing and textile waste. According to the Ellen MacArthur
        Foundation, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of textiles is
        landfilled or burned every second globally. Textile production also
        consumes large amounts of resources, including water, energy, and
        chemicals, which contributes to environmental degradation. As a society,
        we need to take action to reduce the impact of electronics and textiles
        on the environment. This includes implementing sustainable practices for
        the production and disposal of these materials, promoting the use of
        recycled materials, and encouraging consumers to make environmentally
        conscious choices. By working together, we can create a healthier and
        more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
